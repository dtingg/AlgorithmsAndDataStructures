Quiz 7
Question 1
Given a 2d array representation of a Tic Tac Toe board, determine if
there is a winner. Recall that Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid and
a winner is declared if there is any single row, column, or diagonal that
belongs to a single player. The grid entries will either contain an 'X'
or an 'O', indicating which player that cell belongs to.

The input is a 2d array:
[
  ['X', 'O', 'X'],
  ['X', 'X', 'O'],
  ['O', 'O', 'X']
]
In the above board, X is a winner (the diagonal from upper-left to lower-right).

You don't need to check if the input board would be impossible to get to given
the rules of the game â€” you only need to see if there's a winner given the rules above.
